DirectX 11 texture converter tool sample
========================================

This sample implements a tool for DirectX 11 texture conversion in C++. It also includes the "DirectXTex" texture content processing library implementation. The sample builds a Win32 desktop command-line tool texconv which is used to convert image files to various Direct3D compatible DXGI formats, generate mipmaps, apply texture compression, and store in a .DDS file suitable for use at runtime.

This sample is written in C++ and requires experience with graphics programming and DirectX.
