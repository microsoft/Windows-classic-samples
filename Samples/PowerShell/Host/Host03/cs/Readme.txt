Host Sample 03
==========================
     This sample application shows building a fairly complete
     interactive console-based host which allows users to run
     cmdlets and see the output. This sample reads commands from
     the command line, executes them, and displays the results to
     the console. The sample user interface classes are built on
     top of System.Console.
