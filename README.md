# Windows classic samples

This repo contains samples that demonstrate
the API used in Windows classic desktop applications.

**Note**. You can use Microsoft Visual Studio to search the entire set of source code here to see whether the usage of a particular Windows API is being demonstrated. Clone this repo (or download the ZIP) to your local file system. Then **Find in Files** in Visual Studio, set **Look in** to the folder you cloned or downloaded into, and search for an API name. You can install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) without expense. A Community edition is available&mdash;it's free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals.

These samples demonstrate the functionality and programming model
for Windows and Windows Server.
This repo contains Visual Studio solution (SLN) files for each sample,
along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata
needed to compile and run the sample.
For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages,
and APIs demonstrated in these samples,
check out the documentation on the
[Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421).

Most of these samples were created
for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2
using Visual Studio 2013,
but some were created with earlier versions,
or with specific SKU and other requirements.
In many cases, the samples will also work on later versions than the ones indicated.
If you cannot get a sample to work as expected,
it might have platform, version, or SKU-specific requirements.
If you have any issues with the samples, please provide feedback using the Issues list.

To get a copy of Visual Studio, go to
[Visual Studio Downloads](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=301697).
