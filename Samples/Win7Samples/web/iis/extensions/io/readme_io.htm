The <b>Asynchronous Write</b> sample demonstrate asynchronous WriteClient functionality in the ISAPI interface.
The <b>Synchronous Read</b> sample demonstrates synchronous ReadClient functionality in the ISAPI interface. 
The <b>Synchronous Write</b> sample demonstrate synchronous WriteClient functionality in the ISAPI interface.

  <h4><a name="ovr"></a>Sample Overview</h4>
  <p>ISAPI 1.0 support synchronous IO operations via callback 
methods ReadClient() and WriteClient(). The ability to 
support asynchronous operations is important; it frees 
up a server pool thread from being blocked to complete 
the IO operation. In addition, IIS server engine already 
has built in support to manage asynchronous IO operations 
using the completion ports and server thread pool. </p>

<p>ISAPI 2.0 supports asynchronous write operation using 
the existing callback function WriteClient() with a special 
flag indicating that the operation has to be performed 
asynchronously. In addition, ISAPI 2.0 also provides a 
mechanism to request the server to transmit a file using 
the TransmitFile() .</p>

<p>ISAPI 3.0 supports asynchronous read operation from the 
client using ServerSupportFunction() with HSE_REQ_ASYNC_READ_CLIENT 
and a special flag indicating that the operation has to be 
performed asynchronously. In addition, the ISAPI application 
should submit a callback function and context by calling 
ServerSupportFunction() with HSE_REQ_IO_COMPLETION.</p>

  <h4><a name="bld"></a>Build and Install the Sample</h4>
  <p>To build  this sample using the Visual C++ IDE, the following
  steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the solution (VS.NET) or desktop (VS6) file to open the project.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Build</b> to create the DLL.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To build and run this sample without using the Visual C++ IDE, the
  following steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Type <b>NMAKE All</b> from the command line. For example, if your sample files are located in 
	a folder called <code>C:\MySamples</code>, type the following at the command line:
      <pre>cd /d c:\MySamples
NMAKE All</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To install this sample, the following steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Copy the compiled .dll files to a physical folder on your computer. For example, 
  create a folder called <code>C:\Samples</code> and copy the files to that folder.</li>
  <li>Create a virtual directory that maps to the physical folder containing your files. To create 
  a virtual directory, open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager by clicking <b>Start</b>, 
  <b>Run</b>, type <code>inetmgr</code> in the text box and click <b>OK</b>. Right-click on the Web 
  site where you want to create a virtual directory, click <b>New</b>, and click <b>Virtual 
  Directory</b>. In the <b>Alias</b> text box, type the name you want for your virtual directory, for 
  example, <code>InputOutput</code>. In the <b>Directory</b> text box, type the path to the 
  folder that contains your files.
  <li>Configure strong security on your new virtual directory. Right-click the virtual directory name, 
  click <b>Properties</b>, and click the <b>Directory Security</b> tab. Press F1 for tips on 
  securing your virtual directory.</li>
  <li>Use Windows Explorer to set restricted access control on the sample .dll file in its physical folder. 
  For more information, click <b>Start</b>, <b>Help and Support</b>, and search for <b>Access Control</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <font size="2"><a href="#top">to top</a></font>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><a name="run"></a>Run the Sample</h4>
  <p>In order to run this sample, follow the instructions listed below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Copy a file that you want to transfer to any physical folder on your computer, provided that the 
	folder is mapped to a virtual directory. For example, if you have an image file called 
	<code>sample.gif</code>, copy it to the same folder that contains your compiled .dll files since you 
	already mapped that folder to a virtual directory.</li>
    <li>In Internet Explorer (IE), browse to each .dll as if it were a Web file, and pass in a query 
	string containing the name of a file to transfer. For example, if the 
	file you want to transfer is called <code>sample.gif</code>, and it is in the same folder as 
	your sample .dll files, and that folder is mapped to a virtual directory called 
	<code>InputOutput</code>, type one of the following in the address bar of IE, depending on which 
	sample you want to view:
  <pre>http://localhost/InputOutput/AReadCli.dll
http://localhost/InputOutput/FTrans.dll?/InputOutput/sample.gif
http://localhost/InputOutput/FWAsync.dll?/InputOutput/sample.gif
http://localhost/InputOutput/ReadCli.dll
http://localhost/InputOutput/FWrite.dll?/InputOutput/sample.gif
  </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
