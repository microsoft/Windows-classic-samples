Abstract:

    This C file includes sample code for sending an invitation
    with the Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Collaboration APIs.

Notes:
    * This peer to peer application requires global IPv6 connectivity.

    * This sample relies on having existing contacts who are actively
      signed in.  This sample does not offer the ability to add new
      contacts.  To do this, the Contacts samples may be run.
