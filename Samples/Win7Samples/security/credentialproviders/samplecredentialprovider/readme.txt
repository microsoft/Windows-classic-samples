Overview
--------
This sample implements a simple credential provider. A credential provider allows a 3rd 
party to provide an alternate way of logging on. For example, a fingerprint solution vendor 
would write a credential provider to interact with the user and send the appropriate 
credentials to the system for authentication.

This sample implements a simplified credential provider that is based on the password 
credential provider that ships with Windows.  When run, the credential provider 
should enumerate two tiles, one for the administrator and one for the guest account. Note 
that unless your machine is non-domain joined and you have enabled the guest account, it is 
likely that the guest account is disabled and you will receive an error if you try to use that 
tile to log on.  

How to run this sample
--------------------------------
Once you have built the project, copy samplecredentialprovider.dll to the System32 directory
and run Register.reg from an elevated command prompt. The credential should appear the next
time a logon is invoked (such as when logging off or rebooting the machine).

What this sample demonstrates
-----------------------------
This sample demonstrates simple password based log on and unlock behavior.  It also shows how to construct
a simple user tile and handle the user interaction with that tile.

What this sample does not demonstrate
-------------------------------------
- other credential provider scenarios, like participating in credui or handling change password.  
- every possible field that you can put in your user tile
- any network access prior to local authentication (the Pre-Logon Access Provider (PLAP) behavior)
- an event based credential provider (like a smartcard or fingerprint based system)

Parts of the sample
-------------------
common.h - sets up what a tile looks like
CSampleCredential.h/CSampleCredential.cpp - implements ICredentialProviderCredential, which describes one tile
CSampleProvider.h/CSampleProvider.cpp - implements ICredentialProvider, which is the main interface used by LogonUI
										to talk to a credential provider.
Dll.h/Dll.cpp - standard dll setup for a dll that implements COM objects
helpers.h/helpers.cpp - useful functionality to deal with serializing credentials, UNICODE_STRING's, etc
