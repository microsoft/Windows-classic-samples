 * Description: 
 * Root for the "Debug" Desktop Gadget sample. 
 * Demonstrates the System.Debug Sidebar API.
 * 
 * NOTE: 
 * The Microsoft utility 'DebugView for Windows' can be used to
 * view the error message generated by the System.Debug.outputString 
 * in this sample. DebugView is an application that lets you monitor 
 * debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network 
 * that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both 
 * kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't need a debugger 
 * to catch the debug output this gadget generates.
